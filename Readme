This is a project that will display a map of the last position of the Tesla car.

There are tree cars in the database, but this service will be configured to display only one of them.

One car will be default, but you can change it via system env.

There will be a /select page where you can select the car to display. and then per car will have /car/{id} page to display the map of the last position of the car.



The map page will display the last position of the car.
It will also display the last time the position was updated and the speed of the car at that time.

It will ask for location of the user, and if the user allows it, it will display the distance and eta from the car to the user.

Its suppose to show like a "Your car is here" and "Your location is here" on the map, and a line between them.

Our data is being captured by teslamate.

The service will be deployed on Kubernetes.

It will have car.sindrema.com as the domain name, and it will be accessible via https.

Frontend should be in Vue.js and backend in Go.

If vue supports server side rendering, lets just query the data on the server side and render the page with the data, instead of doing it on the client side.

If not, then lets create a simple API in Go that will query the data from the database and return it as JSON, and then the frontend will fetch the data and render it.

Just create a openapi spec for the API, and then we can use it to create the backend later.
